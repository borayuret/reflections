When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    To have a backup at outside of my local machine. And be able to reach to the code from different devices.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


    Remote repository must be updated with controlled commits.
	

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of repository on Github from another account.
    Clone is a repository copy from git to github or vice versa.
    Branch is a copy from master barnch to try experimental changes, they do not reflect on master if not merged.
