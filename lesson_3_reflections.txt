When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    To have a backup at outside of my local machine. And be able to reach to the code from different devices.



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


    Remote repository must be updated with controlled commits.
