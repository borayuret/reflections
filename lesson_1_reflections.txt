How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You see the differences between the old and new version of the file, 
    so you would be able to see the bug.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more 
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Maybe, i could decide to use the old version of a functionality and do not
    have to worry about keeping old versions with the entire history.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

    Pros: logical changes, clean log history
    Cons: loosing unsaved changes before finishing the logical change.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files
 in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?    

     Saving multiple files in one commit is much more useful approach than the other,
     especially when coding. Multiple files together forms a running package.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all commits to the file. git diff compares to commits' differences.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

    We can go to any commit point with git checkout.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For coding works.
